                    Education begins with a safe place to learn. At Africare, we construct and renovate schools across Africa to give children the classrooms they deserve—spaces that are sturdy, well-equipped, and conducive to learning. Many communities lack even basic school infrastructure, with students often studying under trees or in crumbling buildings. We change that.
                        Durable Classrooms, Built to withstand weather, with proper lighting and ventilation.

                        Helping educators stay in rural areas longer.

                        Sanitation facilities, that Separate toilets for girls and boys to keep students in school.

                        Learning materials like Books, desks, and technology to fuel young minds.

                    We train local builders and source materials sustainably, creating jobs while constructing schools designed by communities, for communities. Each new school becomes a hub of hope—where children gain literacy, confidence, and tools to break the cycle of poverty.

                    Build the future. Support our school construction projects and watch generations thrive.
